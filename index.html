    <!--   javascript{
        it is a lightweight web scripting language used to make a weapp/website 
        iinteractive by adding functionality and some logic 
        it is used in both frontend and backed {
            in the frontend >>functionality through dom manipulation {
                clicking buttons,anchors links,menu links ,pop pus 
                form validation 
            }
            in the backed{
                user validation ,system logic,api logic and intergration 
            }

            in the frontend we use framewors like {
                react.js >library/framework
                next.js
                vue.jx
            }

            in the backend  frameworks that are used are build on top of node.js {
          node.js is a runtime javascript environment>javascript can  can be execured outside 
          the web browser
          with node .js we have frameworks suck as express .js{it is an API that 
            it will hanlde server side rendering {
                will be responsible for communicating with the databse and authorising info
            }
          }
            }
        }
      }

      how do i output something in javascript>console .log 
      
      javascript is used in three ways{
        internal >we use the script tags to execute javascript
        external >we create an external file and link it using the script src tag on the bottom part of the code just before the body tags 
        this is done for the purpose of optimization 
        in other scenarios we have the js tag linked to the head tag via a defer keyword >>the file wont be executed untill it completes the html file

        inine>>we use the onclick method to embedd javascript code 
      }
      -->




      <script src="/datatypes.js"></script>
